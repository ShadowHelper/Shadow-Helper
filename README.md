# Shadow Helper
 Shadow Helper, the multipurpose discord bot.


# How to install
It is not recomended to self host the Shadow Helper discord bot as it is not always up to date.\
I recomend you use the bot hosted by me as it is up to date.
\
\
Make sure you have python downloaded. To check to see if you do have python download follow these steps:\
Open up command prompt\
Type
```sh
python --version
```
If it comes back with Python VERSION then you have python installed\
If it doesn't and comes back with python --version is not a recognized as an internal command\
Follow these setups to install python:\
Install python by clicking [here](https://python.org)\
\
\
Once Python is installed you need to clone the repository by click code then download as zip.\
\
Open up the zip file and extract the files into a folder.\
\
Rename example_config.py to config.py.\
\
In the config.py file replace TOKEN with your discord bot token.\
\
Open up command prompt and by using CD navigate to the folder you put the bot files in.\
\
Type
```sh
pip install py-cord --pre
pip install motor pynacl youtube-dl
```
\
Install ffmpeg exes into the bot directory [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
\
Then type
```sh
python bot.py
```
\
The bot should start up.\
\
When creating the oAuth link to add the bot to your server you need to make sure you tick bot and application.commands

# Editing Code

\
The only thing I ask of you is you keep my trade mark in the help command this is just to show who the actual bot developer is and where they can add the bot themselves\
